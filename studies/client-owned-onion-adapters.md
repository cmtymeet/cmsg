# Client-owned profile and message stream adapters

This is a bounded development recommendation after the `0.1.0-alpha.1` release. It does not change that published archive, add a mobile application or establish a new Tor deployment. The profile protocol remains owned by cfrm; cmsg supplies reusable byte framing and its existing onion-only connection boundary.

## Shared wire boundary

Use a four-byte unsigned big-endian length followed by exactly that many payload bytes. Length must be nonzero and no larger than the configured limit, with a hard ceiling of 1 MiB. Validate the length before allocating its body. One absolute deadline covers header and body together; a write deadline includes flushing. Neither partial progress nor a new chunk renews the deadline. Invalid lengths, truncation, I/O failure, timeout and cancellation make the owned framed stream unusable.

| Layer | Payload and bounds | Separate responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Generic `FramedStream<S>` | Opaque bytes; explicit maximum 1..1,048,576 and positive frame deadline at most 60 seconds | No JSON, identity, route selection or anonymity claim |
| cfrm profile wire | Exact UTF-8 JSON envelopes; current example maximum 100,000 bytes and 30-second frame deadline | `hello` then `read`, no pipelining, at most two stages, bounded proof concurrency and connection count; total session at most 300 seconds, example 120 seconds |
| cmsg message transport | Serialized MLS objects bounded by `MAX_WIRE_BYTES` | Current admission, recipient introduction rules, epoch control and local persistence; application text remains independently bounded and validated |

`FramedStream` is generic over Tokio's async read/write traits. It can wrap an application stream returned by the existing `OnionTransport`, and need not force a future maintained embedded-Tor adapter through a TCP proxy. A caller-provided socket is only a byte stream. The codec must not label it anonymously verified or infer routing from its peer address. Each wrapper owns its stream, exposes no destination-changing operation, and requires exclusive mutable access for one operation at a time. The caller must not reuse an independently retained socket clone after a framing failure.

The existing `OnionTransport` accepts only a checksum-valid v3 onion host and explicit port, forwards the name through its trusted loopback SOCKS connection, uses fresh isolation credentials and applies a 45-second connection deadline. It does not start or authenticate Tor. The existing Tor probe already uses this length prefix, but its ad-hoc reads have no per-frame deadline and its trusted CLI accepts an arbitrary listener bind address. Those example choices are not a reusable listener security boundary.

## Owner activation and closure

The host must validate loopback binding before opening the listener and keep its profile handler inactive until a trusted publication provider binds the actual listener address to the expected onion endpoint. The returned endpoint must match the current certified rendezvous lease. A boolean `verified` field, a signed owner statement or a loopback connection alone cannot prove that Tor controls the route. A fresh profile activation session belongs to the owner client, with no reader identity or per-view operator call.

For a managed C Tor adapter, the control protocol can create a service with an explicit local target, omit `NonAnonymous` and `Detach`, and discard the returned private key. The service is then tied to its creating control connection; Tor rejects an anonymity-mode mismatch. Removing it does not close existing application sockets, so the host must also close those on expiry or deactivation. This is a design recommendation based on the [official Tor control protocol](https://spec.torproject.org/control-spec/commands.html#add_onion), not an implemented control adapter.

Connection and proof concurrency limits remain necessary alongside byte deadlines. The owner must recheck lease/session validity after asynchronous work and before returning text, close accepted sockets on shutdown and avoid identifying application logs. Frames do not contain IP addresses, stable reader labels or a new operator receipt. Neither generic framing nor a socket test proves that the host has enforced these rules.

## Execution boundary

The new nine fail-first Rust specifications cover real loopback fragmentation and consecutive frames, exact binary writes, immediate length rejection, truncated headers/bodies, slowloris input across the header/body boundary, blocked writes, cancellation and invalid configuration. Bounded duplex streams exercise deterministic backpressure. These are codec tests, with no real Tor claim; implementation follows actual runtime red on the existing Crow worker.

The earlier isolated experiment passed on a disposable GitHub runner in [run 34258388661](https://github.com/corbet-labs/cmsg/actions/runs/34258388661), using nine real Tor processes and official Chutney revision `6cc158868d722e652975cb4efd5b278d95ff2fbb`. Repeating it needs `tor`, `tor-gencert`, the matching Chutney source and Python dependencies, owned temporary network data and loopback ports. The original workflow installed these only on that disposable runner. Its public-network counterpart failed at bootstrap and remains unverified.

Crow repository 10, pipeline 11 at `16fddbab90d28e48854911b4742f0932c1a0fa0d` reports no `tor`, `tor-gencert` or `arti` executable. Python 3.14.7 and `timeout` are installed. Chutney compatibility with that interpreter and its installed prerequisites are not established; absent Tor binaries already prevent an actual isolated-network rerun. No host configuration was probed and no tools were installed for this review. An embedded maintained Tor dependency is a separate future decision, not part of this framing slice.
